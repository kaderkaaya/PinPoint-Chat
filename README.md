Secure Messaging and Group Management Platform
This repository contains the backend for a robust and secure messaging application with advanced group management functionalities. It's built with Node.js and features JWT-based authentication for secure user interactions.

Key Features:
User Authentication & Authorization:

Secure Registration: Users can sign up with their credentials.

JWT-Based Authentication: Upon successful login, users receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure session management and authorization.

Passwordless Login (via Nodemailer): Users can conveniently log in using a one-time code sent to their email via Nodemailer, enhancing security and user experience.

Private & Group Messaging:

Direct Messaging: Users can engage in one-on-one private conversations.

Group Creation & Management: Users can create new groups, invite others, and manage group participants.

Real-time Communication: (Implied, but good to state if true) Facilitates real-time message exchange within private and group chats.

Contact Management:

Add & View Contacts: Users can add other users as contacts and easily view their network.

Secure & Scalable Architecture: (Optional, but good to add if applicable)

Designed for security and scalability, ensuring reliable performance as the user base grows.

This project aims to provide a secure and efficient platform for communication, whether it's direct messages or collaborative group interactions.
